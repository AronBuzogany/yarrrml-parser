# YARRRML Parser

This library allows to convert [YARRRML](https://w3id.org/yarrrml) rules to [RML](http://rml.io) or [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) rules.

## Install

- `npm i -g @rmlio/yarrrml-parser`

## Usage

### CLI

If you want to generate RML rules from a YARRRML document, you do the following: `yarrrml-parser -i rules.yml`.
The rules will be written to standard output.
If you want to write them to a file, you can add the `-o` option.

### Library

`npm i --save @rmlio/yarrrml-parser`

```
let yarrrml = require('@rmlio/yarrrml-parser/lib/yarrrml2rml');

const yaml = "[yarrrml string]";
const y2r = new yarrrml();
const triples = y2r.convert(yaml);
```
